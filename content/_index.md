Oh, hello. I'm Aaron, a learning technologist and instructional designer with a passion for developing technologies that lead to engaging, student-centered learning experiences - and for building and maintaining systems that make those experiences more efficient, scalable, and impactful.

At the core of everything I do, both professionally and personally, is curiosity. As an educator and technologist, my job isnâ€™t just to answer questions but to ask the right ones:
- Is this the best way?
- How can I do this more effectively and efficiently?
- Did that lesson, tool, or technique actually work?
- What can I automate to save time and improve outcomes?
