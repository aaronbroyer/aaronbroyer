Hi, I'm Aaron, a learning technologist and instructional designer. I build the tools, workflows, and learning systems behind great instruction so they’re easier to run, easier to scale, and easier to support long-term.

I’m focused on practical edtech: reducing friction for instructors, using evidence to guide iteration, and automating the repeatable parts without losing what makes learning feel human.
